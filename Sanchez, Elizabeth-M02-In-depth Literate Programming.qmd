# **3. Styled Assignment: GreenThreads Website Update**

## **Prompt:** Choose a previous class assignment where you had to write a couple of pages. Copy it into Quarto and style it to make it nice.

For this section, I have chosen **Assignment #2**, where I analyzed and improved the **GreenThreads website** to enhance **user engagement and sales**. The following report is styled using **Quarto's formatting features**, making it more structured, readable, and professional.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Introduction**

In this project, I updated the **GreenThreads website** to **better engage visitors** and **motivate them to purchase** or spend more time exploring the site. The changes were made using **marketing theories**, ensuring that each modification improves the **aesthetic appeal** and **enhances functionality** from a **consumer behavior perspective**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Website Enhancements & Marketing Theories Applied**

#### **1. New Customer Offer (Reciprocity Principle)**

A **new 15% discount** for first-time customers was introduced.

-   **Marketing Theory Applied:**
    -   This is based on the **Reciprocity Principle**, where giving a small benefit (discount) increases the likelihood of the customer reciprocating with a purchase.
-   **Implementation & Expected Impact:**
    -   The **"Sale ends today!"** message was added to create **Scarcity & Urgency**.
    -   The **Scarcity & Urgency Theory** suggests that customers act faster when they believe an offer is time-sensitive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **2. Mobile Optimization (Hick's Law)**

The **mobile version** of the website was updated for **better usability** and a **cleaner layout**.

        -   The **shopping cart icon** was positioned on the **right** for quick access.
-   **Hick's Law Applied:**
    -   **Simplified choices** reduce **cognitive overload**, making the website **more user-friendly**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3. Call-to-Action Enhancements (Gestalt Principles)**

A **"Shop Now" button** was strategically placed to **guide customers toward immediate purchases**.

-   **Marketing Theory Used:**
    -   **Gestalt Principles of Visual Hierarchy** -- *Organizing content to guide user focus toward key actions.*
-   **Implementation & Expected Impact:**
    -   The **"Shop Now" button** makes the **path to purchase** **shorter and clearer**, leading to **higher conversion rates**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Conclusion**

The **enhancements to the GreenThreads website** were designed using **psychological marketing principles** to improve user engagement and sales. By applying:
